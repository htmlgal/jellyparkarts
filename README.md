project for comm 270

**my first coding project**
üåü worked from august - december on a basic website displaying my artwork as a means to gain customers. 
üåü used html and css
üåü worked with media queries

**notes:**
- learned html and css through codecademy
- it was overall kind of fun
- got an A

üçÑ happy with:
- multimedia gallery -> media query did its job, looks good
- contact form

üçÑ unhappy with: 
- not particularly happy about the accessibility of this website - doesn't translate well with changing size of desktop window
- should have chosen better colors. gives me hospital vibes
- fonts are also meh
- things don't line up
